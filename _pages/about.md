I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Lei Chen. Before that, I recieved my Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Science from the University of Queensland specialising in Software Engineering and Statistics respectively.

I am currently looking for:
* Research Assistants with a strong (and demonstrable) coding ability (C++).
* Postdoctorate Fellows with a PhD in Computer Science and strong background in graph-based research, either traditional algorithms or machine learning (such as GNNs or Link Prediction).
* Prospective PhD Students with a Bachelor or Masters of Computer Science or Mathematics (preferably with a background in graphs), strong coding (C++) and excellent communication and English writing ability. We may discuss co-supervision with other faculty members at PolyU. I am currently not considering students with only a history of applied Machine Learning research.

If you are interested, please [email me](mailto:alexander.zhou@polyu.edu.hk) with your English CV. For Postdocs and PhD students, please also highlight previous research experience and potential area you would like to research.

My Research Interests
======
My research focus is on graph databases and algorithms, with a specific focus examining social networks. I have worked previously on capturing communities of people who fulfil interesting, social science-driven behaviours whether they be positive (e.g. Diverse) or negative (e.g. Echo Chambers). By identifying positive communities we are able to support the future growth and expansion of that group whilst by identifying negative communities necessary precautions can be taken. Furthermore, I am interested in complex graph types (Uncertain, Temporal, Signed, etc.) as the semantic meanings they hold can provide rich queries and structures unavailable to normal graphs. I also have an interest in database techniques which aid machine learning efficiency, with a particular interest in GNNs, or Vector Databases.
