Hi! I'm Alex! I'm from Brisbane, Australia but am currently a Computer Science PhD Student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Lei Chen. Before that, I recieved my Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Science from the University of Queensland.

My Research Interests
======
My research focus is on Graph Databases, with a focus on modelling communities in social networks. In particular, I am interested in capturing groups of people who fulfil interesting behaviours whether they be positive (e.g. Diverse) or negative (e.g. Echo Chambers). By identifying positive communities we are able to support the future growth and expansion of that group whilst by identifying negative communities necessary precautions can be taken. Furthermore, I am interested in complex graph types (Uncertain, Temporal, Signed, etc.) as the semantic meanings they hold can provide rich queries and structures unavailable to normal graphs.

I also have an interest regardin
