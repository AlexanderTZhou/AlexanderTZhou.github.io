Hi, I'm from Brisbane, Australia and am currently a Research Assistant Professor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Lei Chen. Before that, I recieved my Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Science from the University of Queensland specialising in Software Engineering and Statistics respectively.

I am currently looking for:
* Research Assistants with a strong coding ability (C++ and Python).
* Postdoctorate Fellows with a PhD in Computer Science and strong background in graph-based research, either traditional algorithms or machine learning (such as GNNs or Link Prediction).
* Prospective PhD Students with a Computer Science or Mathematics degree and strong coding ability. We may discuss co-supervision with other faculty members at PolyU.

If you are interested, please [email me](mailto:alexander.zhou@polyu.edu.hk) with your English CV.

My Research Interests
======
My research focus is on graph databases and algorithms, with a specific focus examining social networks. I have worked previously on capturing communities of people who fulfil interesting, social science-driven behaviours whether they be positive (e.g. Diverse) or negative (e.g. Echo Chambers). By identifying positive communities we are able to support the future growth and expansion of that group whilst by identifying negative communities necessary precautions can be taken. Furthermore, I am interested in complex graph types (Uncertain, Temporal, Signed, etc.) as the semantic meanings they hold can provide rich queries and structures unavailable to normal graphs. I also have an interest in database techniques which aid machine learning efficiency, with a particular interest in graph pre-processing for GNNs.
